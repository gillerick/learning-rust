## Learning Rust

This project is for learning fundamentals of Rust programming language

### Primitives

#### Scalar Types

- These include:
    - _signed integers_
    - _unsigned integers_
    - _floating point_
    - _bool_
    - the unit type (), whose only possible value is an empty tuple: ()

#### Compound Types

- These include:
    - arrays like `[1, 2, 3]`
    - tuples like `(1, "two", false)`

- Variables can always be type annotated. Numbers may additionally be annotated via a suffix or by default. Integers
  default to i32 and floats to f64.
- Rust can also infer types from context.
